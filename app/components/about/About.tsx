            I began my programming journey with LEGO Mindstorms, Scratch, and
            16-bit computers in Minecraft (I know it sounds ridiculous). In May
            2023, I graduated magna cum laude from Northeastern University with
            a BS in Computer Science. After having the privilege to develop
            software for three incredible companies, I am now looking for my
            next opportunity as a software engineer.

            My interests outside of tech include space exploration, comic books,
            cooking, and cycling. Some of my favorite movies are Arrival,
            Interstellar, and Into the Spider-Verse. I passionately believe
            Indian food is the best food on the planet.
